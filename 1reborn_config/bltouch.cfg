#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the X, Y position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.
points: 24, 162
        280, 162
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a Z_TILT_ADJUST command.
#   Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
#   the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be
#   provided.
speed: 120
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 8
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
retries: 15
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
retry_tolerance: 0.01
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.
