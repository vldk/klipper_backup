[resonance_tester]
#   This parameter is used to determine which acceleration to use to
#   test a specific frequency: accel = accel_per_hz * freq. Higher the
#   value, the higher is the energy of the oscillations. Can be set to
#   a lower than the default value if the resonances get too strong on
#   the printer. However, lower values make measurements of
#   high-frequency resonances less precise. The default value is 75
#   (mm/sec).
# hz_per_sec: 1
#   Determines the speed of the test. When testing all frequencies in
#   range [min_freq, max_freq], each second the frequency increases by
#   hz_per_sec. Small values make the test slow, and the large values
#   will decrease the precision of the test. The default value is 1.0
#   (Hz/sec == sec^-2).
# sweeping_accel: 400
#   An acceleration of slow sweeping moves. The default is 400 mm/sec^2.
sweeping_period: 0 #1.2
#   A period of slow sweeping moves. Setting this parameter to 0
#   disables slow sweeping moves. Avoid setting it to a too small
#   non-zero value in order to not poison the measurements.
#   The default is 1.2 sec which is a good all-round choice.
accel_per_hz: 75
# min_freq: 5
#   Minimum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 5 Hz.
# max_freq: 133.33
#   Maximum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 133.33 Hz.

# result_folder: ~/printer_data/config/ShakeTune_results
#    The folder where the results will be stored. It will be created if it doesn't exist.
# number_of_results_to_keep: 3
#    The number of results to keep in the result_folder. The oldest results will
#    be automatically deleted after each runs.
# keep_raw_csv: False
#    If True, the raw CSV files will be kept in the result_folder alongside the
#    PNG graphs. If False, they will be deleted and only the graphs will be kept.
# show_macros_in_webui: True
#    Mainsail and Fluidd doesn't create buttons for "system" macros that are not in the
#    printer.cfg file. If you want to see the macros in the webui, set this to True.
# timeout: 300
#    The maximum time in seconds to let Shake&Tune process the CSV files and generate the graphs.
